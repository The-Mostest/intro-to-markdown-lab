# How to build the prefect sandwich

![PB & J sandwhich](./Images/PB%20&%20J.jpeg)

### Part 1:
First and foremost, bread selection is the arguably the most imporant part of the process. Within this process you have 2 choices:
* white Bread
* Brown Bread

After that, you have the **style of bread** you're looking for:
1. Bagguette
1. Soft
1. Crusty
1. Flat

After you've made that selection - it's onto part 2.

### Part 2:

After choosing your bread type. You then need to look at what kind of filling you want. In this case we want ~~savoury~~ sweet!

> ___Personally, I'm a sucker for a peanut butter and jam sandwhich.___

Please see [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRBOgtp0Hac) for the reasons why.

### Part 3:

Assemble your sandwhich.

With this, you need to make sure you are slowly and gracfully placing your sandwhich together. Much like you're coding, if you do this part wrong the enitre thing will `console.log()` nothing.

Slather your bread with your filling of choice and make sure you over fill it. No such thing as too much in this world.

Lastly, hold your bread high above your head, one slice in each hand, and clap with the force of the sun.

### Part 4:

_The end result should look like this:_

| Bread |
| --------- |
| Filling |
| Bread |



Now stop being so dramatic and eat your food you **animal**.
